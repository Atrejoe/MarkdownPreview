# MarkdownPreview
A Windows Preview handler for Markdown files

# Origin
Inspired by [SharpShell](https://sharpshell.codeplex.com/ "Sharpshell"), a well documented framework for creating Windows Shell Extensions, combined with my search for a preview handler for `.md` files this tiny project was born.

#What does it do?
It displays `.md` files as MarkDown in the Windows Preview pane 

#How to install
Until I've found a proper way for installing this extension, the best way to install the Markdown Shell Extension is by using Sharpshells' Server Manager Tool, which can be found at:  [SharpShell releases on GitHub](https://github.com/dwmkerr/sharpshell/releases "SharpShell releases").

#Acknowledgements
Next to SharpShell, special thanks also go out to [Kiri-rin (author of MarkdownSharp)](https://github.com/Kiri-rin/markdownsharp "Kiri-rin"), who had a lightning response when [I requested a signed version of Markdownsharp](https://github.com/Kiri-rin/markdownsharp/issues/71).
