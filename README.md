# MarkdownPreview #
A Windows Preview handler for Markdown files

# Origin #
Inspired by [SharpShell](https://sharpshell.codeplex.com/ "Sharpshell"), a well documented framework for creating Windows Shell Extensions, combined with my search for a preview handler for `.md` files this tiny project was born.

# What does it do? #
It displays `.md` files as MarkDown in the Windows Preview pane 

# How to install #
Download and run the latest installer from [MarkdownPreview releases on GitHub](https://github.com/Atrejoe/MarkdownPreview/releases "MarkdownPreview on GitHub").

# Acknowledgements #
Next to [SharpShell](https://github.com/dwmkerr/sharpshell), this project uses [MarkDig](https://github.com/lunet-io/markdig) styled by [MarkdownPad CSS](https://github.com/nicolashery/markdownpad-github).
